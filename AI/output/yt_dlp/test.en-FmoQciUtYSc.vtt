00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:05.631
Yeah!

00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:07.692
'The Subway Running Above The Stories.'

00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:10.169
I am the driver, DJ Yong.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.662
Let me read the first story

00:00:11.663 --> 00:00:13.785
of the part-timer special as a recitation.

00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:14.954
Hello, DJ Yong.

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:17.523
I am a 24-year-old woman, part-time at a barbecue restaurant.

00:00:17.524 --> 00:00:20.015
The other day, four men came to pay the bill,

00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:22.262
But 'Please pick up the ugliest man of us.'

00:00:22.263 --> 00:00:23.508
they said.

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:24.985
So carefully,

00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:26.000
I responded 'That man.'

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:27.092
However, the man said,

00:00:27.723 --> 00:00:29.308
'I am not with them.'

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.154
Oh, my god!

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:32.785
What happened!

00:00:32.786 --> 00:00:34.246
She must have been upset!

00:00:34.247 --> 00:00:36.031
Let me give the 'Ssook in Frozen Pork Belly'

00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:37.046
some gift

00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:38.277
as a way to cheer you up!

00:00:38.278 --> 00:00:39.138
Next story,

00:00:39.923 --> 00:00:41.954
It's a very long story.

00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:43.431
Let me try this.

00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:45.138
Hello, DJ Yong.

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:47.200
I'm 26-year-old man

00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:48.877
working in a sandwich store.

00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:49.985
I have

00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:51.354
a concern.

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:52.138
The reason is

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:53.677
one consumer.

00:00:56.892 --> 00:00:59.538
The consumer usually orders 'Italian BMT.'

00:00:59.816 --> 00:01:00.923
Hello, this is Italy.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.523
Oh, this is SUBWAY.

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:04.369
If the consumer appears,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.354
I feel like a broken machine.

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:07.123
Hello.

00:01:07.646 --> 00:01:08.538
How are you?

00:01:11.323 --> 00:01:13.692
With a small height, round eyes,

00:01:13.693 --> 00:01:16.077
and front teeth that resemble a rabbit's when in thought,

00:01:16.078 --> 00:01:18.923
possessing all the cuteness,

00:01:18.924 --> 00:01:20.308
the consumer appears at the same time every day,

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:21.738
making my heart flutter.

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.200
Please Italian BMT 15cm.

00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:24.908
Yeah.

00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:29.231
Picking bread, vegetables, cheese,

00:01:29.232 --> 00:01:31.308
and sauce, she walks with me.

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:33.785
Yet, the time we walk feels too short.

00:01:33.786 --> 00:01:35.400
I know all the vegetables

00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:38.277
and sauces she likes,

00:01:38.278 --> 00:01:40.708
but just to spend a little more time with her,

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:41.938
I would pretend

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.246
not to understand to ask her again.

00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:44.723
Please hold the pickle.

00:01:44.724 --> 00:01:45.723
Yeah.

00:01:49.523 --> 00:01:51.400
What a lovely story!

00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:52.185
Just a sec.

00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:53.800
The writers go

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:54.723
happy in front of me.

00:01:55.462 --> 00:01:56.523
I wish

00:01:56.524 --> 00:01:58.492
she would order a 1-meter-long sandwich.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:01:59.846
So lovely.

00:01:59.847 --> 00:02:00.754
Okay, let me keep reading.

00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:02.862
It was one day.

00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:03.708
Hello.

00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:08.862
She appeared

00:02:08.863 --> 00:02:10.769
with a handsome guy

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.846
in the store.

00:02:12.877 --> 00:02:13.508
What's that?

00:02:13.878 --> 00:02:14.662
Is he her boyfriend?

00:02:14.663 --> 00:02:15.523
No way.

00:02:15.524 --> 00:02:16.200
Writer, it's not, is it?

00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:17.446
Don't make me frustrated.

00:02:17.447 --> 00:02:18.046
If it's true,

00:02:18.278 --> 00:02:20.062
I won't read this.

00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:23.231
Hello.

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:25.723
How are you?

00:02:25.724 --> 00:02:28.385
One 'Italian BMT SUBPICK'

00:02:28.386 --> 00:02:30.462
and one 'Rotisserie Barbecue Chicken SUBPICK' please.

00:02:31.723 --> 00:02:32.523
SUBPICK is not

00:02:32.524 --> 00:02:34.954
not that you pick the ingredients one by one

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:36.169
but that we pick for you

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.538
the best ingredients in the best chemistry.

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.169
So the order time is so short.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.985
Are you okay?

00:02:41.723 --> 00:02:42.492
Yeah!

00:02:43.554 --> 00:02:44.923
Because SUBPICK consists of the best ones,

00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:46.800
the order process can fishies

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:48.077
so simply

00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:49.862
and fast.

00:02:49.863 --> 00:02:51.123
Are you really okay?

00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:53.323
Tell him 'I'm not okay.'

00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:55.800
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:02:58.385 --> 00:02:59.215
Yeah,

00:02:59.216 --> 00:03:00.308
okay.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.723
He wants to see her more even just a little bit,

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.308
so my heart hurts too much.

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.477
Thank you.

00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:09.615
Just with 'Please SUBPICK'

00:03:09.616 --> 00:03:10.892
the one word,

00:03:10.893 --> 00:03:12.215
The order was completed

00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:14.046
quickly and efficiently

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.569
This path I used to walk with her,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.662
now,

00:03:18.663 --> 00:03:20.846
I have to walk alone.

00:03:26.923 --> 00:03:28.338
Let me help you with the payment.

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:32.892
At the moment,

00:03:32.893 --> 00:03:34.092
the man asked me.

00:03:34.401 --> 00:03:35.015
Are you crying?

00:03:40.323 --> 00:03:42.046
No, the onion makes me cry.

00:03:46.338 --> 00:03:47.908
It seems so tasty.

00:03:58.508 --> 00:03:59.615
So good.

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.708
I've considered many thoughts,

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.477
such as whether he is her brother

00:04:03.478 --> 00:04:05.615
or a cousin.

00:04:05.616 --> 00:04:07.000
How about trying this?

00:04:12.692 --> 00:04:14.815
Yet, a brother wouldn't feed her a sandwich, would he?

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:17.507
Like this,

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.277
my unrequited love is

00:04:19.278 --> 00:04:20.569
over.

00:04:20.815 --> 00:04:22.385
What's that!

00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:24.323
Come on, It can't end like this.

00:04:25.938 --> 00:04:28.185
My heart really hurts.

00:04:28.186 --> 00:04:29.231
I want to give

00:04:29.232 --> 00:04:32.154
the 'Rabbit eating onion' some big gift.

00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:37.908
Hey, guys, the story isn't

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.231
over yet!

00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:40.569
I've just heard there are a few pages.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.662
Let me read this!

00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:43.508
A few days later,

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.154
Hello, this is SUBWAY.

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:50.692
She starts to appear

00:04:50.693 --> 00:04:52.000
alone in the store.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.138
However,

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.154
she looks sad and disappointing

00:04:56.155 --> 00:04:58.231
that I've never seen before.

00:04:58.832 --> 00:05:00.369
Even I couldn't see her front teeth.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.292
Please one STEAK &amp; CHEESE SUBPICK.

00:05:03.062 --> 00:05:05.031
Yeah, let me give you in a moment.

00:05:22.508 --> 00:05:24.108
Isn't the onion a little bit spicy?

00:05:33.462 --> 00:05:34.200
After that day,

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:35.200
she doesn't

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:36.169
visit

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.108
the store anymore.

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:40.508
With the hope that she might hear this story,

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:41.800
I send my story

00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:42.815
to DJ Yong

00:05:42.816 --> 00:05:44.308
as if talking to myself.

00:05:46.185 --> 00:05:47.523
I guess it's over!

00:05:47.524 --> 00:05:48.815
What should he do?

00:05:48.816 --> 00:05:49.800
The back page was even more bittersweet!

00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:50.938
I shouldn't have read this!

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:52.046
Oh, my.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.323
Okay!

00:05:53.324 --> 00:05:54.508
Let me see...

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:55.877
It seems like she broke up with her boyfriend.

00:05:55.878 --> 00:05:57.077
Yeah, I'm sure the breakup.

00:05:57.078 --> 00:05:58.292
The reason!

00:05:58.293 --> 00:06:00.538
Even the menu she ordered alone has changed.

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.308
It seems like she has felt changed feelings.

00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:06.077
Out of all the stories

00:06:06.078 --> 00:06:06.985
I've read so far,

00:06:06.986 --> 00:06:08.677
this one hit me the hardest!

00:06:09.047 --> 00:06:10.954
I want to give the 'Rabbit eating onion'

00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:13.169
some big gift.

00:06:16.123 --> 00:06:18.415
What kind of gift

00:06:18.416 --> 00:06:19.938
should I send to make him happy?

00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:21.723
I want

00:06:21.724 --> 00:06:23.308
just both of you to be happy.

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:24.715
As a DJ Yong,

00:06:24.716 --> 00:06:25.985
I'm rooting for you two.
