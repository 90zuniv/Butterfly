00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:08.954
Will you just go home?

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:11.753
Don't talk to your elder brother like that.

00:00:11.754 --> 00:00:12.877
What the...

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:15.137
- You really ask for a lot.
- What?

00:00:15.138 --> 00:00:16.261
Sweet, sweet, sweet

00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:19.800
yeon yang gang.

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:20.815
It's bam yang gang.

00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:23.260
Bam yang gang!

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:24.646
You're a beaver, not BIBI.

00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:26.846
It's good.

00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:28.153
Ugh, so disgusting.

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.061
Hey, it's your boyfriend.

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.645
Why isn't he doing it to me?

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:32.984
Hey, Hyukjoon.

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:34.061
What are you doing?

00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:36.399
I'm at Kyunam's house.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.368
Where is she?

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:39.384
Kim Kyunam?

00:00:39.491 --> 00:00:40.491
Pfft.

00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:43.444
- She's pooping.
- Oh.

00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:46.076
Please don't tell her this

00:00:46.077 --> 00:00:47.368
and listen to me carefully.

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:48.630
It's Kyunam's birthday tomorrow

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:50.460
and I was planning to throw her a surprise birthday party.

00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:51.968
But she always catches these things

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.429
so I'm going to do it a day earlier.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.306
I'm going to go there

00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:57.676
so can you pretend you don't know about this

00:00:57.677 --> 00:00:58.922
and open the door for me?

00:00:58.923 --> 00:01:00.844
Oh, okay...

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:01.922
Thank you.

00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:02.952
I'll see you later.

00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:09.767
- Oh, my gosh!
- What should we do?

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.737
Why did you do it in speaker mode?

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.060
How am I supposed to know he'll say this?

00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:14.860
What's he up to?

00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:16.152
You should work hard on your reaction.

00:01:16.153 --> 00:01:18.367
I'm bad at pretending not to notice anything.

00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:19.690
I think I'll crack up

00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:20.906
watching you.

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:24.198
You're so annoying!

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:25.413
Okay.

00:01:25.414 --> 00:01:27.659
Laugh right now!

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.074
- Check this out.
- Go ahead.

00:01:30.982 --> 00:01:33.259
- Oh, what's this?
- Hey, that's too obvious!

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.675
Then how do I do it?

00:01:34.676 --> 00:01:36.044
What do you think Hyukjoon will give you?

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.552
- A wallet.
- How do you know?

00:01:37.553 --> 00:01:39.752
We share the same YouTube ID

00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:41.382
and I keep seeing

00:01:41.383 --> 00:01:42.890
"best women's wallets."

00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:44.427
No, I think that's a trick.

00:01:44.428 --> 00:01:45.890
He's not good at that.

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:49.182
No, I think it's his smart strategy after considering sharing YouTube ID.

00:01:49.183 --> 00:01:51.013
That can't be it.

00:01:51.982 --> 00:01:53.105
It's Hyukjoon.

00:01:54.228 --> 00:01:56.396
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm here to buy a wallet.

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:00.613
I'll be there in ten minutes.

00:02:00.614 --> 00:02:02.536
Oh, you bought a wallet?

00:02:02.537 --> 00:02:04.120
Kyunam used hers for too long

00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:05.705
so I looked it up for the last few days.

00:02:06.536 --> 00:02:08.335
[(I told you)]
Please make sure

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:09.951
you don't tell her about this.

00:02:09.952 --> 00:02:10.966
I won't.

00:02:11.212 --> 00:02:12.920
- Hyukjoon.
- Yes?

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.335
Kyunam won't have a clue about this, right?

00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:18.628
She'll never know this time.

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.304
You're a very thorough person.

00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:21.504
Yeah, see you soon.

00:02:22.597 --> 00:02:23.966
You're so good at acting!

00:02:23.967 --> 00:02:25.304
This is how you should do it!

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:26.427
When will Hyukjoon ever

00:02:26.428 --> 00:02:28.104
throw a successful surprise party?

00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:29.720
But he's really cute.

00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:30.766
Such a cutie.

00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:31.858
Sweet boy!

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.227
Sweet bam yang gang!

00:02:33.228 --> 00:02:34.766
Yay, I'm getting a wallet!

00:02:35.273 --> 00:02:36.273
He's calling again.

00:02:36.612 --> 00:02:37.612
Answer it.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.396
Hey, yang gang. I mean, Hyukjoon.

00:02:39.397 --> 00:02:40.412
I'm debating

00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:41.658
between pink and white.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.242
I don't know what to choose.

00:02:43.243 --> 00:02:45.612
Could you sound her out?

00:02:45.613 --> 00:02:46.735
How? How do I do that?

00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:47.996
Uh...

00:02:47.997 --> 00:02:49.750
Can't you do something?

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:52.119
Okay, hold on.

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:55.319
Kyunam, do you like pink or white?

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.796
Why're you asking me that?

00:02:59.257 --> 00:03:00.257
Stop...

00:03:00.842 --> 00:03:02.841
You have to sound natural.

00:03:02.842 --> 00:03:03.842
Okay, wait.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.596
It's a psychological test!

00:03:07.473 --> 00:03:08.549
What psychology?

00:03:10.226 --> 00:03:11.288
Mob psychology...

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:15.519
Kyunam is very quick at sensing things.

00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:17.395
I'm almost done.

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:19.657
Just tell me which color you like!

00:03:20.272 --> 00:03:21.857
- White!
- White?

00:03:21.858 --> 00:03:23.318
Oh...

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.534
White?

00:03:24.535 --> 00:03:26.195
Oh, no...

00:03:26.196 --> 00:03:27.241
Haa..

00:03:27.242 --> 00:03:29.072
No, I like pink!

00:03:29.073 --> 00:03:30.072
She said pink.

00:03:30.073 --> 00:03:31.657
Oh, pink! Okay!

00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:33.410
Okay, see you later!

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.380
Why are you so mean?

00:03:37.381 --> 00:03:39.210
I really want to tease him

00:03:39.211 --> 00:03:40.379
when he does these things.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.426
He'll be here soon.

00:03:41.427 --> 00:03:43.256
Let's get ready!

00:03:43.257 --> 00:03:44.272
Try the reaction again.

00:03:44.964 --> 00:03:45.979
Oh, what is this?

00:03:46.472 --> 00:03:48.102
Don't laugh!

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:49.256
You have to act really surprised!

00:03:49.257 --> 00:03:51.594
It's so funny that I'm preparing knowing about this.

00:03:56.148 --> 00:03:57.394
He's here!

00:03:57.395 --> 00:03:58.733
Oh, gosh!

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:03.317
- Should I open it?
- Wait a second.

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:04.779
Hey, don't laugh.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.025
Hold it back.

00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:07.040
Let's laugh once more.

00:04:10.071 --> 00:04:11.071
Oh!

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:12.117
- Oh!
- Hey!

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:15.086
Hoo...

00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:16.286
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:18.625
I'm really going to open it.

00:04:42.655 --> 00:04:43.655
Hey...

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:48.116
You said you're getting her a birthday gift.

00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:53.455
I said it was a surprise.
