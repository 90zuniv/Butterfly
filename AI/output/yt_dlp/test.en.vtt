They say between ten years many things change

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:23.996
I'm seeing this guest almost in ten years.

00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:25.447
Wanted to meet so much

00:00:25.448 --> 00:00:27.208
[(Lonely) / (Rather than Myungsoo focused on welcoming special guest...)]
but it's not easy to invite this guest.

00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:28.878
many of you love her so much

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:30.051
[(Nervous)]
and I love her so much

00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:31.633
IU!

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.405
[Myungsoo has been knowing her for ten years]
Should I've introduced her more?

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:38.614
- IU.
- Hello.

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:40.625
[IU is a star who doesn't need any  more description]
- Hello.
- IU.

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:42.757
What have you brought to me.

00:00:42.758 --> 00:00:45.968
[Awkward]
Didn't you just pick this up from somewhere?

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.113
- I blowed like this.
- Don't lie to me. Don't lie.

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:51.268
[(Having fun to tease teacher)]
Did you really blow air in it? Maybe not.

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:52.698
[She didn't make it]
I filmed an advertisement before coming here

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.579
[Warm]
and I brought it as it looked so pretty.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.900
[Park Myungsoo(53) / Currently advertisement 0 / For request of advertisement @dj_gpark]
- Did you film advertisement?
- I went there. I just filmed and came here.

00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:59.098
- So envy you.
- I brought this.

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:02.375
[(So thankful) / (Bow)]
- Thank you. Thank you. How long has been passed.
- In a long time.

00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:03.221
Teacher...

00:01:03.222 --> 00:01:04.157
It really has been a while.

00:01:04.158 --> 00:01:06.070
- Teacher you are so.
- Why. What's wrong?

00:01:06.071 --> 00:01:08.413
[Sad]
You look so small now.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.019
It's not like that.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.056
If you say like that

00:01:12.057 --> 00:01:13.350
then someone might think I'm sick.

00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:16.408
[IU, you can't go anywhere]
It's not that. Sit here. You can't go anywhere.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.179
It wasn't ten years. In the meantime we sometimes met.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.434
[Coincidentally met after finishing radio / Reference : YouTube Myungsoo looking for talented impersonator]
- Greeted each other after finishing radio.
- I saw you when you were passing by.

00:01:22.435 --> 00:01:23.402
I suddenly was like

00:01:23.403 --> 00:01:25.997
- why aren't you visiting my radio?
- He always says like this.

00:01:25.998 --> 00:01:28.460
[(How can I go there when I'm not invited...)]
- With strong voice.
- I can visit there when you cast me.

00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:30.264
So I could agree.

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:31.210
- Right.
- I didn't cast her.

00:01:31.211 --> 00:01:32.177
You didn't cast me.

00:01:32.178 --> 00:01:33.848
I'm so thankful about that.

00:01:35.104 --> 00:01:37.478
- And...
- I came out as soon as you cast me.

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.468
No, no. It's not that.

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.029
[(With no excuse)]
There are a lot to say.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.372
[(I shouldn't have talked about it)]
We'll talk about it later in second episode.

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:45.968
As you filmed advertisement so aren't you full?

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.529
- No, no. I'm so...
- You must be full.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.191
[So hungry]
- I didn't eat anything before coming here.
- Hey IU.

00:01:50.192 --> 00:01:51.598
Actually when you film advertisement, even you didn't

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:52.544
have anything you must be full.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.985
- Even I don't eat anything?
- It's been like eight years

00:01:54.986 --> 00:01:56.173
[(He is hungry for eight years)]
- since I filmed last advertisement.
- Right, right.

00:01:56.174 --> 00:01:58.043
That's also right but

00:01:58.044 --> 00:01:59.406
as you're going to prepare meal for me so

00:01:59.407 --> 00:02:00.704
I intentionally didn't have anything.

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:03.123
[So true]
- You're eyes don't lie.
- I'm being honest.

00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:04.751
- Okay, okay.
- I'm so hungry now.

00:02:04.752 --> 00:02:07.192

Then you order whatever you want to have.

[(Considering)]
As I'm so hungry right now so

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:12.141
- Don't act but comfortably.
- I'm so hungry for sure.

00:02:12.142 --> 00:02:14.846
[Staring]
- Really?
- Feels like my face is losing weight.

00:02:14.847 --> 00:02:16.129
How come you look more prettier.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.264
- Really?
- Yes.

00:02:17.684 --> 00:02:19.201
[Myungsoo wants to get prettier]
- What do you eat?
- What I eat...

00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:20.389
Why are you so pretty.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.587

What should I eat.

00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:36.400
Something cheap. Cheap...

00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:38.358
[(Considering mode ON)]
So what do you really want to eat?

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:39.787
[(Menu recommendation is needed)]
Can't you recommend something...

00:02:39.788 --> 00:02:41.613
Don't you want to eat steamed clam?

00:02:41.614 --> 00:02:43.328
[(Can't figure out his menu choice)]
Steamed clam?

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.928
Others ordered lots of strange menus.

- ITZY came here and ate yellow tail.
- Yellow tail.

They ordered something like tuna sushi.

What do you want to have?

00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:54.784
I actually want to have jajangmyeon.

00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:56.437
- That came to my mind.
- Jajangmyeon?

00:02:56.438 --> 00:02:58.225
[At infinite challenge song festival / (First day of recording)]
When I first visited your recording studio

00:02:58.226 --> 00:02:59.714
- with my guitar.
- Right, right.

00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:01.210
You ordered jajangmyeon for me.

00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:02.206

Right, I did.

00:03:02.207 --> 00:03:03.079
Right X4

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.443
That came to my mind and

00:03:04.444 --> 00:03:05.652
since yesterday I wanted to eat jajangmyeon.

00:03:05.653 --> 00:03:07.082
Didn't I make you to become a celebrity at that time?

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:10.315
[Of course I agree]
- Yes, thanks to you. I became popular.
- If you didn't come out infinite challenge then...

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:12.009
[It's just personal opinion]
Right, right so there are a lot to talk...

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.900
So what's your schedule today?

00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:16.774
[Only HalMyungSoo]
- I don't have any more schedule.
- Right?

00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:17.793
There are a lot to talk.

00:03:17.794 --> 00:03:19.304

Then I would order fried rice.

00:03:19.305 --> 00:03:21.585
[(IU's pick : Jajangmyeon + sweet and sour pork)]
Then I would order jajangmyeon and sweet pork.

00:03:21.586 --> 00:03:23.380
[(Tap...)]
I'll order them.

00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:24.418

- We'll help you.
- Okay.

Anyway thank you so much for coming here even you're busy.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.069
I should've come here earlier.

- Why did you come here so late?
- I'm sorry.

00:03:36.577 --> 00:03:38.842
[Embarrassed]
No, no. You shouldn't say that.

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:41.193
I actually

end of last year...

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:45.488
[(Myungsoo called her all of a sudden)]
You called me all of a sudden so

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.167
- Yeah, I would call you suddenly. I can't tell you when to call.
- Yes. So...

00:03:48.168 --> 00:03:49.487
It wasn't something like broadcasting right?

00:03:49.488 --> 00:03:50.850
[(He personally called her)]
- It wasn't.
- You just called me right?

00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:52.795
No, I can't do something like that.

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:55.117
I even couldn't organize comeback schedule.

[(After two ring bell she picked the phone up)]
- You received after two bell ring.
- Yes, after two ring.

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:59.516
I picked the phone up and

00:03:59.517 --> 00:04:03.519
[Pinggyego / Zzabbro]
You said 'If you visit Jaesuk or Dongyeop's program then...'

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.197
'you're out'.

00:04:06.198 --> 00:04:08.578
[Sudden threat]
Suddenly without any plan.

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.172
[That's not true]
- She's exaggerating.
- No, I'm not.

00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:11.745
- No.
- I didn't say like that.

00:04:11.746 --> 00:04:12.669
I didn't exaggerate a bit.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.189
IU, are you staying well.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.382
In this cold weather are you having good time?

When you plan to promote new music or work

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.324

come out on my program first.

00:04:22.325 --> 00:04:24.062
[Stammer Stammer]
When did I say Jaesuk?

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.371
You named those two people.

00:04:26.372 --> 00:04:29.956
[(Gave up) / Repeating again]
If you go out Jaesuk and Dongyeop's program then you're out.

00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:33.871
[(First warm greeting, later threat]
- I dind't say you're out...
- No, you also mentioned that.

00:04:33.872 --> 00:04:35.652
You're out and I won't see you again.

00:04:35.653 --> 00:04:36.774
[(Right)]
You said 'I won't see you again'.

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:37.808
[Gave up saying excuse]
I didn't see her for ten years

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:39.479
there wouldn't be that much difference even I don't see her.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.361
But I feel very sorry as

00:04:42.362 --> 00:04:44.582
[IU, even with those words went to Pinggyego first]
I visited Jaesuk's program first...

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:46.865
At that time I was at coma state.

00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:49.619
[Out of mind]
I was at coma state... So I thought

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.426
[She promised me though...]
IU is not that type of a person.

00:04:51.427 --> 00:04:54.479
She is the person who picks her phone up after two ring bell.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.679
[(=You went there because he called you right?)]
At that time Jaesuk called you to come out

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.446
right?

00:04:57.732 --> 00:04:58.832
[IU has fidelity so...]
Jaesuk must have called her.

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.902
It's same as Jeong Hyung-don called long time ago.

00:05:00.903 --> 00:05:01.935
As Jaesuk called...

00:05:01.936 --> 00:05:04.714
[No]
I asked to go out.

00:05:04.715 --> 00:05:06.005
I asked to go out.

00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:10.106
[Today my whole world is collapsing...]

00:05:10.107 --> 00:05:12.763
Wait, call the ambulance.

00:05:12.764 --> 00:05:14.692
But to be honest

00:05:14.693 --> 00:05:15.660
I forgot about that call

00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:17.155
at that time.

00:05:17.156 --> 00:05:18.563
[(That can be true but I'm thirsty)]
- That's possible.
- And then

00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:21.521
[Completely forgot]
I went Pinggyego to meet Jaesuk and

00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:23.974
[Ah, I promised Myungsoo]
- I suddenly remembered your words.
- Really?

00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:25.608
Myungsoo said I'll be in trouble.

00:05:25.609 --> 00:05:27.295
[(Waiting failed)]
So

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:30.594
[Sullen]
at that place I told the truth and called you.

00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:33.338
At that time... Jaesuk suddenly called me and

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.994
'Bro, tikita according to the rhythm' and then 'Spin guitar'

00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:39.567
[(Huh...?)]
I felt something strange.

00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:42.405
[So suspicious tikita]
There's no reason for Jeasuk to say tikita to me all of a sudden.

00:05:42.406 --> 00:05:44.223
When you said spin your head also spinned.

00:05:45.188 --> 00:05:46.430
Are you teasing me?

00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:48.454
[No]
Hey IU visited there?

00:05:48.455 --> 00:05:51.242
[(Quickly telling the truth)]
Teacher, I forgot to go out that program first. I'm sorry.

00:05:51.243 --> 00:05:53.292
- She told the truth.
- I told you the truth...

[On Halmyungsoo]
But I'll show what's to do one's best

[IU, doing one's best]
- on your program.
- I'll show how I do my best.

00:05:57.098 --> 00:05:58.350
I'll spin three times tumbling.

00:05:58.351 --> 00:06:00.616
[(Revealing IU doing tumbling for the first time)]
- Tumbling...
- I'll do whatever you ask me to.

00:06:00.617 --> 00:06:03.717
Going back to my newbie mind.

00:06:03.718 --> 00:06:06.488
[(IU full of passion)]
- I came here to do whatever I need to.
- Really? Are you going to show whatever you got?

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:07.126
Of course.

00:06:07.127 --> 00:06:08.732
I couldn't sleep after hearing

00:06:08.733 --> 00:06:11.525
you coming out this program.

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:55.016
She is really...

00:19:55.017 --> 00:19:57.300
so beautiful.

00:19:57.301 --> 00:20:00.017
[(Amazed all over again after 10 years)]
- Wow. The fact that they got Tang Wei in music video...
- Thankfully.

00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:00.680
[(Amazed all over again after 10 years)]
- Wow. The fact that they got Tang Wei in music video...
- Thankfully.

00:20:00.681 --> 00:20:02.445
So, what is the new song about?

00:20:02.446 --> 00:20:04.488
[In the mini album, incredibly]
There are two title tracks.

00:20:04.489 --> 00:20:06.220
One song is really exciting.

00:20:06.221 --> 00:20:08.016
[First title song, Shopper]
- It's a song called "Shopper."
- Sofa.

00:20:08.017 --> 00:20:10.335
Your shopper.

00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:11.986
[Shopper (O) / Sofa (X)]
- I meant this sofa.
- Not this sofa.

00:20:11.987 --> 00:20:13.687
Saying it's a sofa because it's very comfortable, saying it's a sofa.

00:20:13.688 --> 00:20:16.118
- People shopping.
- Right, X3

00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:19.235
This song is called "Shopper," don't hold back.

00:20:19.236 --> 00:20:24.051
['Show your desires freely']
Just unleash your desires, like that.

00:20:24.052 --> 00:20:25.036
And the other second song is

00:20:25.037 --> 00:20:26.265
[Second title song, Holssi]
It's a song called "Holssi,"

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:27.477
This song has a bit of hipness to it.

00:20:27.478 --> 00:20:29.861
I will live as a spore, not a flower.

00:20:29.862 --> 00:20:32.504
I felt like I was not a flower.

00:20:32.505 --> 00:20:34.842
I thought I would bloom as a flower.

00:20:34.843 --> 00:20:36.543
It has bloomed... It has bloomed now.

00:20:36.544 --> 00:20:37.983
[I want to live as a Holssi]
I feel like I'm not a flower.

00:20:37.984 --> 00:20:39.682
I too will soon become a flower of the afterlife...

00:20:39.683 --> 00:20:41.692
[First reveal of Holssi]
This song is somewhat like this, roughly.

00:20:41.693 --> 00:20:45.882
[(Getting confirmation from the teacher)]

00:20:45.883 --> 00:20:48.839
Fly high to bloom.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.643
If someone asks about my well-being

00:20:51.644 --> 00:20:57.818
Tell them if there's anyone who asks

00:20:57.819 --> 00:20:59.799
That they have become a Holssi.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.069
[My reaction watching this right now.mp4)]

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.184
[Doomchit / (A born-to-be dancer who can't hide her talent)]
The song is nice.

00:21:03.185 --> 00:21:05.161
- There's also dance.
- Suddenly, why the dance all of a sudden.

00:21:05.162 --> 00:21:06.992
[Flustered]
Why suddenly dance?

00:21:06.993 --> 00:21:08.482
This is what the song is like.

00:21:08.483 --> 00:21:09.826
[Front row fan service]
Shall I also rap for you?

00:21:09.827 --> 00:21:10.860
It would be nice if you do.

00:21:12.048 --> 00:21:13.292
Just do everything, all of it.

00:21:13.293 --> 00:21:16.084
[Top of Korean hip-hop takes off]

00:21:16.085 --> 00:21:19.158
Always carry your sunglasses for your eyesight.

00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:24.519
[Getting absorbed]
Looking up, it's dazzling, not scared of heights at all.

00:21:25.024 --> 00:21:27.114
[(Buzzing) / A dark wizard controlling Park Myung-soo)]

00:21:27.115 --> 00:21:29.859
I will go up and look down nonchalantly.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.679
Riding the clouds, having a blast for once.

00:21:34.858 --> 00:21:37.648
[We'll completely mess up our hearts]
That's it.

00:21:37.649 --> 00:21:38.454
[The reason is]
It's too good.

00:21:38.455 --> 00:21:39.554
I really like this.

00:21:39.555 --> 00:21:40.604
I'll download it.

00:21:40.605 --> 00:21:42.061
- Go ahead and download it.
- Oh, okay, okay.

00:21:42.062 --> 00:21:43.501
[Jjajangmyeon has arrived]
The delivery is here.

00:21:44.039 --> 00:21:46.341
Why did so much come?

00:21:46.342 --> 00:21:47.215
What's this?

00:21:47.216 --> 00:21:48.298
What is this?

00:21:48.299 --> 00:21:49.299
Seems like it's food?

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.390
Fish-fragrant eggplant.

00:21:51.391 --> 00:21:52.489
What?

00:21:53.254 --> 00:21:55.523
We ordered it well on our own.

00:21:55.524 --> 00:21:57.110
I really have to eat a lot today.

00:21:57.111 --> 00:21:59.608
Sorry, you two, but you've been staring at each other too much.

00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:00.707
That's right.

00:22:01.407 --> 00:22:04.896
[Forgot to film because of happiness]
- Because we like it.
- Because it's been so long, it's dear to see him after such a long time.

00:22:04.897 --> 00:22:05.896
That's right.

00:22:05.897 --> 00:22:06.897
I will enjoy the meal.

00:22:06.898 --> 00:22:08.238
Eating well is eating well, but

00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:09.988
I was really very hungry.

00:22:09.989 --> 00:22:11.623
Hey, but are these noodles all right?

00:22:11.624 --> 00:22:13.209
[Firm]
No, just like this.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:14.047
The noodles

00:22:14.048 --> 00:22:15.992
[(Disassembling)]
- Later
- If you need me, let me know.

00:22:15.993 --> 00:22:17.383
[IU's Palette]
Please come to Palette as well.

00:22:17.384 --> 00:22:18.660
I'll sing live there.

00:22:18.661 --> 00:22:20.116
[(Of course)]
You should definitely do it live there.

00:22:20.117 --> 00:22:22.760
It would be great if you could come to"Palette" and sing 'Love wins all'.

00:22:22.761 --> 00:22:25.551
[Confident]
Could you make a song for me?

00:22:25.552 --> 00:22:26.552
Does it feel like a burden?

00:22:26.553 --> 00:22:27.813
Now, if it's not possible, just say it's not possible.

00:22:27.814 --> 00:22:30.425
- No, it's not possible.
- Okay, got it, got it.

00:22:30.426 --> 00:22:31.426
Good.

00:22:31.427 --> 00:22:32.654
- Okay.
- Too...

00:22:32.655 --> 00:22:35.327
[Firm]
I don't like making promises I can't keep.

00:22:35.328 --> 00:22:37.906
[(Ah, cried again today)]
Yes, yes, yes.

00:22:37.924 --> 00:22:39.363
Then you really won't have any days off.

00:22:39.364 --> 00:22:40.364
I don't have any these days.

00:22:40.804 --> 00:22:42.667
[Tour starting soon]
- Keep practicing for the concert
- and practicing for the concert.

00:22:42.668 --> 00:22:44.254
[Comeback schedule]
And there's YouTube too.

00:22:44.255 --> 00:22:45.793
[(Clingy)]
Then, where did you appear on YouTube?

00:22:45.794 --> 00:22:48.828
That's the end with DdeunDdeun, Pixid, Halmyungsoo.

00:22:48.829 --> 00:22:49.667

Well done.

00:22:49.668 --> 00:22:51.108

Any other places you'd like to recommend?

00:22:52.354 --> 00:22:54.346
No, I absolutely don't want to recommend any.

[(Teasing the teacher is exciting)]

00:22:55.593 --> 00:22:58.448
[(Even a bite of jjajangmyeon)]

00:22:58.449 --> 00:22:59.465
This place is delicious.

00:22:59.466 --> 00:23:00.954
[Distrust in the production team]
But it's still edible.

00:23:00.955 --> 00:23:02.687
Everyone's eaten, right? Yes.

00:23:02.704 --> 00:23:03.574
It's dinner time.

00:23:03.575 --> 00:23:05.893
No, no, it seems everyone has already eaten.

00:23:07.423 --> 00:23:08.977
They sneak it in.

00:23:08.978 --> 00:23:11.930
Then how do you normally eat?

00:23:11.931 --> 00:23:13.582
Mostly order delivery.

00:23:13.583 --> 00:23:15.136
[Food craze lately]
Just lately, it's scorched rice.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.490
I now buy a big bag of it.

00:23:17.491 --> 00:23:18.247
Really.

00:23:18.248 --> 00:23:20.842
When I have no appetite, I boil some scorched rice.

00:23:20.843 --> 00:23:23.730
It's good with some side dishes.

00:23:23.731 --> 00:23:25.285
Get a chef for your home.

00:23:26.409 --> 00:23:29.785
[??? : If you can afford it, you should!]
If you can afford it, have like 3 chefs in residence at your home.

00:23:29.786 --> 00:23:31.746
From what I see, even so.

00:23:31.747 --> 00:23:33.154
Basically, someone like IU by now.

00:23:33.155 --> 00:23:35.391
Should be contacted by places like the community center.

00:23:35.392 --> 00:23:36.392
Because she's a world star.

00:23:36.393 --> 00:23:38.662
[Modesty]
- No, no, no.
- You bring in foreign currency.

00:23:38.663 --> 00:23:40.981
[IU must eat well!]
World stars should be taken care of by the community center.

00:23:40.998 --> 00:23:42.454
Call to check if you've eaten.

00:23:42.455 --> 00:23:43.895
Have you had your meal?

00:23:43.896 --> 00:23:48.036
Myungsoo always talks about 'Park Myung Soo's Friends' concert, you know?

00:23:48.037 --> 00:23:50.973
[(Feigning ignorance)]
Just need to book IU for that, and it's all set.

00:23:50.974 --> 00:23:52.299

No, that's not it.

00:23:52.853 --> 00:23:53.983
No, no.

Born as an artist.

00:23:57.255 --> 00:23:58.451
I should try having my own concert at least once.

00:23:58.452 --> 00:24:00.053
Right, right, concerts are really something else.

00:24:00.054 --> 00:24:01.119

Yeah, so...

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.348

Many friends say they'll come.

00:24:05.854 --> 00:24:07.293
The company's stance is quite different.

00:24:08.221 --> 00:24:09.664
[Myungsoo]
Personally, I think...

00:24:09.665 --> 00:24:10.848
Like aespa or maybe...

00:24:14.735 --> 00:24:15.816
Le Sserafim would also come...

00:24:15.817 --> 00:24:19.607
[(Something's off)]
Le Sserafim is said to have quite a different view from the company, so now...

00:24:19.609 --> 00:24:20.917
It seems possible with ITZY.

00:24:20.919 --> 00:24:22.066
Then there's Chungha.

- All of The Boyz
- You've cast all of them?

00:24:24.825 --> 00:24:26.183

- Yes, yes, yes, that's right.

00:24:37.187 --> 00:24:38.693
Be honest with me here.

00:24:38.694 --> 00:24:39.971
You don't lie anymore, so...

00:24:39.972 --> 00:24:41.118

00:24:45.205 --> 00:24:47.734
Yeah X6

00:24:47.735 --> 00:24:49.598

00:24:49.599 --> 00:24:50.664
30 teams, 30 teams.

00:24:50.665 --> 00:24:52.056
- So, 30 teams
- But then, that's

How many songs do I need to do?

00:25:17.412 --> 00:25:19.095
Maybe about 7 songs.

One song might be a bit disappointing, so...

00:25:23.793 --> 00:25:25.558
Including 'Leon', three songs?

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:26.348
If that's a lot...

00:25:26.349 --> 00:25:30.961
Teacher, you should try to develop it a bit more.

00:25:30.962 --> 00:25:32.841
But someone has to come for it to be developed.

00:25:32.842 --> 00:25:34.233

I'll give you a definite answer.

[(Only whether it can happen matters)]
- So, there's a possibility?
- Yes, yes, yes.

So, the other friends too

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.931
- It could just be you as the friend
- That's not it.

- Is that not okay, too?
- That, that's not okay.
