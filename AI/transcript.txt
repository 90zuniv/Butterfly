Will you just go home? Don't talk to your elder brother like that. What the... - You really ask for a lot.
- What? Sweet, sweet, sweet yeon yang gang. It's bam yang gang. Bam yang gang! You're a beaver, not BIBI. It's good. Ugh, so disgusting. Hey, it's your boyfriend. Why isn't he doing it to me? Hey, Hyukjoon. What are you doing? I'm at Kyunam's house. Where is she? Kim Kyunam? Pfft. - She's pooping.
- Oh. Please don't tell her this and listen to me carefully. It's Kyunam's birthday tomorrow and I was planning to throw her a surprise birthday party. But she always catches these things so I'm going to do it a day earlier. I'm going to go there so can you pretend you don't know about this and open the door for me? Oh, okay... Thank you. I'll see you later. - Oh, my gosh!
- What should we do? Why did you do it in speaker mode? How am I supposed to know he'll say this? What's he up to? You should work hard on your reaction. I'm bad at pretending not to notice anything. I think I'll crack up watching you. You're so annoying! Okay. Laugh right now! - Check this out.
- Go ahead. - Oh, what's this?
- Hey, that's too obvious! Then how do I do it? What do you think Hyukjoon will give you? - A wallet.
- How do you know? We share the same YouTube ID and I keep seeing "best women's wallets." No, I think that's a trick. He's not good at that. No, I think it's his smart strategy after considering sharing YouTube ID. That can't be it. It's Hyukjoon. - Hey.
- Hi, I'm here to buy a wallet. I'll be there in ten minutes. Oh, you bought a wallet? Kyunam used hers for too long so I looked it up for the last few days. [(I told you)]
Please make sure you don't tell her about this. I won't. - Hyukjoon.
- Yes? Kyunam won't have a clue about this, right? She'll never know this time. You're a very thorough person. Yeah, see you soon. You're so good at acting! This is how you should do it! When will Hyukjoon ever throw a successful surprise party? But he's really cute. Such a cutie. Sweet boy! Sweet bam yang gang! Yay, I'm getting a wallet! He's calling again. Answer it. Hey, yang gang. I mean, Hyukjoon. I'm debating between pink and white. I don't know what to choose. Could you sound her out? How? How do I do that? Uh... Can't you do something? Okay, hold on. Kyunam, do you like pink or white? Why're you asking me that? Stop... You have to sound natural. Okay, wait. It's a psychological test! What psychology? Mob psychology... Kyunam is very quick at sensing things. I'm almost done. Just tell me which color you like! - White!
- White? Oh... White? Oh, no... Haa.. No, I like pink! She said pink. Oh, pink! Okay! Okay, see you later! Why are you so mean? I really want to tease him when he does these things. He'll be here soon. Let's get ready! Try the reaction again. Oh, what is this? Don't laugh! You have to act really surprised! It's so funny that I'm preparing knowing about this. He's here! Oh, gosh! - Should I open it?
- Wait a second. Hey, don't laugh. Hold it back. Let's laugh once more. Oh! - Oh!
- Hey! Hoo... - Okay.
- Okay. I'm really going to open it. Hey... You said you're getting her a birthday gift. I said it was a surprise.
